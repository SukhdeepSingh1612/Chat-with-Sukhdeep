My name is Sukhdeep Singh. I'm a software engineer, entrepreneur, and AI enthusiast based in India. I’ve been working in tech while exploring practical AI solutions that can make an impact locally. Right now, I’m focused on upskilling through AI courses and building tools like coding assistants and financial news analyzers.

I’m big on experimentation—whether it’s with tech or food. North Indian dishes are my comfort zone, but I love trying new cuisines too. I recently got an iPhone and still find myself geeking out over the latest iOS features. Always curious, always building—that’s how I like to keep moving.
